// Miner-local PR-outcome record (#4274). The miner's OWN local record of the outcomes of its OWN PRs — merged or
// closed — written to the miner's local SQLite via the generic append-only event-ledger.js, mirroring how
// manage-status.js layers a specific typed event (MANAGE_PR_UPDATE_EVENT + a payload normalizer + a thin writer)
// on top of that same ledger.
//
// DISTINCT from the server-side `pr_outcome` concept: src/review/outcomes-wire.ts's `recordPrOutcome` writes
// `pr_outcome` rows to the HOSTED backend's D1 audit tables from the GitHub App's webhook stream — that is the
// loopover SERVER recording ground truth for every contributor. THIS is a laptop-mode miner's local record of
// its own PRs (it may have no webhook relay at all): same concept name, different codebase layer, no shared code.
// The distinct `MINER_PR_OUTCOME_EVENT` local constant keeps the two from being conflated.
