// (jsdom + the React plugin + a Testing-Library cleanup setup) so the design system's own logic-bearing exports
// are verified directly, not only incidentally through whichever consuming app happens to import them. No
// `coverage` block: this package is deliberately not in the root vitest.config.ts's coverage.include and is not
// Codecov-gated -- the acceptance signal is that this suite runs and passes, not a percentage (see the issue).
