// FIFO merge-train gate (#selfhost-merge-train). Without this, a PR merges the instant its OWN gate clears,
// with zero awareness of an older sibling PR still open in the same repo -- proven live via a production D1
// query to cause hundreds of out-of-order merges per repo, and the conflicts that follow. This module is the
// pure decision only: a still-viable, OVERLAPPING older sibling (not conflicted, not past the staleness cap)
// holds the newer PR's merge until the older one either merges, closes, or goes stale. Mirrors this codebase's
// existing "advisory, fail-open, defense-in-depth" lock philosophy (see claimTransientLock's own doc comment)
// rather than a hard, unbypassable serialization -- the staleness cap is the deliberate escape hatch so one
// stuck old PR can never block the repo's newer PRs forever.
//
// Overlap-scoped by design (#selfhost-merge-train-overlap), not blanket FIFO: the actual problem this gate
// exists to prevent is a merge CONFLICT (or duplicated issue-closing effort) from two PRs touching the same
// area merging out of order -- not "any newer PR must wait for any older PR, related or not." A newer PR whose
// files/linked-issues share nothing with an older sibling creates no conflict risk by merging first, so it
// never waits, REGARDLESS of that sibling's review state (this is also what keeps a PR stuck in manual review
// from silently wedging the ENTIRE queue -- it can only ever hold up a PR that actually overlaps it). An
// overlapping older sibling DOES still count as a blocker even while held for manual review: letting the
// newer, overlapping PR merge first doesn't remove the conflict risk, it just defers it to whenever the older
// PR resumes (a normal rebase-on-conflict then, versus every newer related PR queueing behind it now) -- an
// acceptable, bounded tradeoff given the 24h staleness cap already prevents an abandoned PR from blocking
// forever.
